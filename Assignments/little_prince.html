    <p>
        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. 
        <span class="highlight-yellow">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. 
        It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> 
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, 
        and I said to myself: 
        <span class="highlight-red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
        <span class="highlight-red">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose 
        that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> 
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, 
        as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
